// In order to set up the webpack config 

// 1. Go to package.json and make an entry for "start": "webpack-dev-server"
// {
// "scripts": {
//     "start": "webpack-dev-server"
// }
// }

// 2. Now when we run npm start we get an error for webpack cli so npm install --save-dev webpack-cli
// After we install webpack-cli still we see that our browser cannot understand the JSX syntax hence we have to create 
// a new file with package.json which will be webpack.config.js
